# JACDAC PADAUK

This repository contains an implementation of JACDAC for the PADAUK family of microcontrollers, in particular the PADAUK PMS150C.

Contained in the `button` and `neopixel` folders respectively is code that causes the PMS150C to advertise a button or an RGBLED service. From another JACDAC device, applications can detect different button presses and change the colour of the Neopixel remotely.

## Programming

To build programs for the PMS150C you'll need to obtain the [PADAUK IDE](http://www.padauk.com.tw/en/product/show.aspx?num=17). To flash the microcontroller you'll need to alao download the program writer and obtain a physical hardware programmer.
